# Road-Accident-Analysis

This Project aims to provide insightful and comprehensive analysis of road accidents using the powerful data visualization capabilities of Microsoft Power BI. This project utilizes real-world data related to road accidents, such as accident locations, causes, vehicle types, and associated factors, to extract valuable insights and support evidence-based decision-making in the field of road safety. The insights derived from the project can be used to implement targeted interventions, enhance road safety measures, and ultimately reduce the frequency and severity of road accidents, leading to safer transportation systems for communities.
